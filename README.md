# Engineering Ladder

This documents ONEHOPE's Engineering Ladder. The Engineering Ladder is a framework to help evaluate performance,
goals, and compensation for engineers at ONEHOPE.

This document is open and evolving. We encourage you to submit issues or pull requests to suggest changes and
ensure our framework is doing the best it can to help ONEHOPE fairly evaluate compensation and career growth for
engineers.

## Tracks

The Engineering Ladder encapsulates two tracks—an individual contributor (IC0–IC5) and manager/executive track
(M1–M4–E1–E2). The manager track is available to engineers who have achieved an "IC3 Senior Engineer" level on the
individual contributor ladder.

```
IC0 > IC1 > IC2 > IC3 > IC4 > IC5
                  M1  > M2  > M3  > M4 > E1 > E2 > E3
```

## Individual Contributors

Individual contributor engineers define a "maker" role at ONEHOPE where a person is responsible for writing code on a
regular basis and has no direct reports. As an individual contributor engineer grows at ONEHOPE the scale and impact
of the code they write and systems they maintain is expected to increase.

### IC0 Intern

- Learns to complete well-defined and subdivided tasks.
- Focuses on learning tools and processes.
- Pushes code through the entire lifecycle from development to production.

### IC1 Junior Engineer

- Has broad knowledge of CS concepts.
- Can complete well-defined and subdivided tasks.
- Focuses on learning tools and processes.

- Has end-to-end responsibility on projects of increasing complexity and contributes to code that is shared across
  projects.

- Sets short to medium-term strategic technical direction.

### IC5 Engineering Lead

- Anticipates broad technical change and ensures ONEHOPE is always ahead of the curve.
- Consistently delivers large systems involving one or more teams' contribution.
- Primarily acts as a multiplier by building systems, authoring tools, or introducing policies or patterns.
- Quickly breaks down complex problems into potential solutions, knowns, and unknowns.
- Creates architecture that enables many potential futures without knowing exactly what the future is.
- Leads the conversations internally about the direction of major areas of the technology.
- Identifies technology strategic growth opportunities that enable ONEHOPE to grow as a business.

## Technical Leads

Every product team at ONEHOPE needs a technical lead. A technical lead is the point person between business, product
and engineering for that project. Their responsibilities are to help keep project management up to date, and to
keep an eye on the larger picture of the project. This role is well suited to IC who has previous experience with
the types of technical work involved. Being a technical lead on a project is a short term role as projects are
launched, and wrapped up with some regularity, making a technical lead not a job title.

## Management

A manager’s role at ONEHOPE balances few individual contributor responsibilities with more people management
responsibilities. As an engineering manager grows at ONEHOPE, any code they write is expected to shift from
delivering direct value on project progress to having a multiplying effect by enabling their team to do better
work. As such, an Engineering Manager has direct reports and their performance is evaluated by the scale and impact
of their team considerably more than the direct impact of the code they write.

## People Management vs Technical Leadership

- People management is orthogonal to technical leadership.
- People management is a responsibility to develop and support people.

**vs**

- Technical Leadership is an official role in a project, not a title.
- Technical leadership is a recognition of technical ability.
- Technical leadership is a responsibility to ship software.

## Directors

Director engineers define a manager role at ONEHOPE that heavily emphasizes people management responsibilities over
writing code on a regular basis. A director's responsibility is to lead process, architecture, and systems that
enable many engineers to do their best work. Engineering directors can have a significant amount of individual
contributors and/or leads as direct reports, and their performance is evaluated by the scale and impact they enable
for their department and its technology.
